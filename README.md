Car Insurance Claim Probability Prediction

This repository contains the code and resources for a machine learning project focused on developing a predictive model to assess the claim probability for car insurance policies. The project aims to revolutionize the way car insurance claims are evaluated, providing accurate assessments and improving decision-making in the insurance industry.

Problem Statement:

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that accurately assesses the claim probability for car insurance policies. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset and employing machine learning techniques, we aim to improve the efficiency and accuracy of claim assessments, leading to optimized risk assessment, premium calculations, and claims management.

Dataset:

The dataset used for this project contains 44 columns and 58,592 rows. It includes various features such as policy tenure, age of car and policyholder, population density, make, airbags, displacement, cylinder, gear box, turning radius, length, width, height, gross weight, ncap rating, and more. The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, address skewness, and encode categorical variables appropriately.
